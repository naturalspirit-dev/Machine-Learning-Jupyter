# Python Machine Learning Notebooks
Essential codes for jump-starting machine learning/data science with Python

### Essential tutorial-type notebooks on Pandas and Numpy
* Jupyter notebooks covering a wide range of functions and operations on the topics of NumPy, Pandans, Seaborn, matplotlib etc.

### Tutorial-type notebooks covering regression, classification, clustering, and some basic neural network algorithms
* Simple linear regression with t-statistic generation
* Multiple ways to do linear regression in Python and their speed comparison ([check the article I wrote on freeCodeCamp](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/data-science-with-python-8-ways-to-do-linear-regression-and-measure-their-speed-b5577d75f8b))
* Multi-variate regression with regularization
* Polynomial regression with how to use scikit-learn pipeline feature ([check the article I wrote on *Towards Data Science*](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-with-python-easy-and-robust-method-to-fit-nonlinear-data-19e8a1ddbd49))
* Logistic regression/classification
* _k_-nearest neighbor classification
* Decision trees and Random Forest
* Support vector machine classification
* _K_-means clustering

### Function approximation by linear model and Deep Learning method
* Demo notebook to illustrate the superiority of deep neural network for complex nonlinear function approximation task.
* Step-by-step building of 1-hidden-layer and 2-hidden-layer dense network using basic TensorFlow methods 

### Basic interactive controls demo
* Demo on how to integrate basic interactive controls (slider bars, drop-down menus, check-boxes etc.) in a Jupyter notebook and use them for interactive machine learning task
